# Eventful-moment

## Here is my Week 3 and 4 solution to the Special Man Global Solution Bootcamp assignment.
This assignment included the creation of a prototype. I used Tailwind CSS and Vue.js to build this project. I also implemented authentication to the project with Postman and Axios.


The prototype is seen in the screenshot below:
